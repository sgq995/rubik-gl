## Libraries
__SDL2__ is built for archlinux using CMake instead of autotools [[ref](https://discourse.libsdl.org/t/arch-linux-cmake-find-package-sdl2-required-passes-but-doesnt-find-anything/24226)]. This adds a weird behaviour to include the SDL2 into a CMake project. Alternative you can follow [this tutorial](https://trenki2.github.io/blog/2017/06/02/using-sdl2-with-cmake/) to install SDL2 correctly and be able to compile the project.
